# ForgeTM Lite — Archived

This directory contains the archived version of the ForgeTM Lite application.

Reason: Removed from Goblin assistant and demo configuration; archived for now.

If you need to restore the app:

1. Move the `archive/forge-lite` back to `apps/forge-lite`.
2. Re-add the workspace entry to `pnpm-workspace.yaml` and `package.json`.
3. Re-enable any Coblin/GoblinOS toolbelt entries if required.

If you need help restoring, contact the repo owners or check the Git history.
