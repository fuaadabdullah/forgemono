Last updated July 18, 2025

When running `vercel` in a directory for the first time, Vercel CLI needs to know which [scope](/docs/dashboard-features#scope-selector) and [Vercel Project](/docs/projects/overview) you want to [deploy](/docs/cli/deploy) your directory to. You can choose to either [link](/docs/cli/link) an existing Vercel Project or to create a new one.

terminal

```
vercel
? Set up and deploy "~/web/my-lovely-project"? [Y/n] y
? Which scope do you want to deploy to? My Awesome Team
? Link to existing project? [y/N] y
? What’s the name of your existing project? my-lovely-project
🔗 Linked to awesome-team/my-lovely-project (created .vercel and added it to .gitignore)
```

Linking an existing Vercel Project when running Vercel CLI in a new directory.

Once set up, a new `.vercel` directory will be added to your directory. The `.vercel` directory contains both the organization and `id` of your Vercel Project. If you want [unlink](/docs/cli/link) your directory, you can remove the `.vercel` directory.

You can use the [`--yes` option](/docs/cli/deploy#yes) to skip these questions.

## [Framework detection](#framework-detection)

When you create a new Vercel Project, Vercel CLI will [link](/docs/cli/link) the Vercel Project and automatically detect the framework you are using and offer default Project Settings accordingly.

terminal

```
vercel
? Set up and deploy "~/web/my-new-project"? [Y/n] y
? Which scope do you want to deploy to? My Awesome Team
? Link to existing project? [y/N] n
? What’s your project’s name? my-new-project
? In which directory is your code located? my-new-project/
Auto-detected project settings (Next.js):

- Build Command: \`next build\` or \`build\` from \`package.json\`
- Output Directory: Next.js default
- Development Command: next dev --port $PORT
? Want to override the settings? [y/N]
```

Creating a new Vercel Project with the `vercel` command.

You will be provided with default Build Command, Output Directory, and Development Command options.

You can continue with the default Project Settings or overwrite them. You can also edit your Project Settings later in your Vercel Project dashboard.
