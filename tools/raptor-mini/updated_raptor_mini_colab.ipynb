    "# Raptor Mini Colab Deployment\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook deploys Raptor Mini (lightweight AI analysis) with ngrok tunneling for the ForgeMonorepo documentation system.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What this does:\n",
    "- Installs Raptor Mini dependencies\n",
    "- Sets up ngrok tunneling\n",
    "- Provides API endpoints for document analysis\n",
    "- Makes the service accessible via public URL\n",
    "\n",
    "## API Endpoints:\n",
    "- `GET /health` - Health check\n",
    "- `POST /analyze` - Document analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "## Usage:\n",
    "1. Run all cells in order\n",
    "2. Copy the ngrok URL from the output\n",
    "3. Update your `.env` file: `RAPTOR_MINI_URL=https://xxxxx.ngrok.io`"
