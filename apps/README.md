# Apps

Polyglot applications that live alongside GoblinOS. Each subdirectory groups apps by language/runtime.

Current layout:

- `python/` — Python applications (moved to dedicated repositories).


Conventions:

- Keep dependencies in local `requirements.txt`.
- Use virtual environments outside the repo (do not commit `.venv`).
- Add language-specific README files describing setup and deployment.
