# Apps

Polyglot applications that live alongside GoblinOS. Each subdirectory groups apps by language/runtime.

Current layout:

- `python/rizzk-calculator/` — Streamlit-based risk vs. reward calculator demo.

Conventions:
- Keep dependencies in local `requirements.txt`.
- Use virtual environments outside the repo (do not commit `.venv`).
- Add language-specific README files describing setup and deployment.
