# Apps

Polyglot applications that live alongside GoblinOS. Each subdirectory contains active applications and projects.

Current applications:

- `goblin-assistant/` — AI-powered development assistant (Python FastAPI backend)
- `forge-lite/` — Trading and risk management application
- `fuaad-portfolio/` — Personal portfolio website
- `gaslight/` — Additional applications
- `python/` — Python utilities and tools
- `raptor-mini/` — Raptor monitoring system components


Conventions:

- Keep dependencies in local `requirements.txt`.
- Use virtual environments outside the repo (do not commit `.venv`).
- Add language-specific README files describing setup and deployment.
