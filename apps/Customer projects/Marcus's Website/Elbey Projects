ELBEY PROJECTS — Website Blueprint & Build Plan
Big decision (I picked one so you don’t stall)

Recommendation: Build with WordPress + Elementor (or a lightweight theme) + managed hosting (affordable, reliable).
Why: cheapest to launch, easiest for the customer to update, huge plugin ecosystem for booking/SEO/analytics, and simple maintenance path. If you want a prettier no-code handoff and don’t mind higher monthly costs, Webflow is the alternative — great design control but pricier.
Zapier
+1

Sitemap (what the site will include)

Home (hero, services, CTA booking, quick contact)

About (experience, Saudi background highlight, trust/credibility)

Services (break out: Maintenance, Engine service, Transmission, Suspension, Brakes, Diagnostics, Mobile Repair, Inspections, Rebuilds — each with a short page or anchor section)

Gallery (Before / After photos, video reels)

Book / Contact (form + phone + map + Google Business embed)

Testimonials / Reviews

FAQ (turnaround, pricing policy, mobile service area)

Blog / Build Log (vlog + posts) — optional but important for SEO

Shop (merch/parts later)

Legal / Policies (T&Cs, privacy, payment terms)

Homepage wireframe + content blocks (priority order)

Hero: Big logo (your red muscle car), headline, 1-line subhead, Primary CTA: Book Inspection (form anchor).

Example headline: Elbey Projects — Honest mobile mechanics & engine service in [CITY]

Subhead: Fast diagnostics • Mobile repairs • 15 years of hands-on experience

Why Us (3 bullets): Price, honest, mobile & reliable (short icons)

Top Services (3-5 cards): Brakes, Oil, Diagnostics, Suspension, Mobile Repair (each with CTA)

Quick booking widget: Date, time range, service type, phone, address — fast path to conversion

Gallery highlight: before/after carousel + video thumbnail

Testimonials: 3–5 quotes with star ratings

About snippet + link to full About

Local SEO block: Service areas + Google Business Profile snapshot (makes Google happy)

Footer: contact, hours (24/7 note), social links, small nav, domain/email

Pages: content & length guidance

Services pages: 300–450 words each, with 3 strong photos and a “book now” CTA.

About: 350–600 words — emphasize 15 years in Saudi Arabia + hands-on experience. Give a short human story.

Gallery: visual-first; captions + 1–2 lines context per project.

Blog posts: 600–1,200 words, local keywords (see SEO section).
Keep copy conversational, clear, and slightly confident — no jive, no nonsense.

Booking Form (fields + behavior)

Name, Phone (required), Email (optional), Service needed (dropdown), Preferred date, Preferred time, Address (or pickup/dropoff), Vehicle make/model/year, Short description, Attach photo (optional), How they heard about you (select)

Integrations: send form to client email + webhook to Zapier/Make for SMS reminders + calendar invite. Add admin dashboard for incoming requests.

Consent checkbox: “I agree to receive SMS/calls about my booking.”

Local SEO essentials (non-negotiable)

Create / claim Google Business Profile and keep NAP consistent (Name, Address, Phone). GBP is a must for local search & calls.
BabyLoveGrowth

Create service-area pages (one page per neighborhood/city you serve) — Google likes local pages.
anatechconsultancy.com

On-page basics: title tags like “Mechanic in [City] — Elbey Projects | Brakes, Engine Service”; meta descriptions; schema for LocalBusiness and Service.

Collect reviews and display them; solicit via SMS link after each job. Reviews boost local rankings fast.
Optimize

Blog ideas: “How to tell if your suspension is shot”, “What a pre-purchase inspection covers” — target long-tail local queries.
Tekmetric

Visual & Brand Assets

Use the red muscle car logo (center stage). Big, bold typeface for headlines — the logo already nails that.

Color palette: Black background, red accent (#c62828), cream/ivory text for contrast (matches logo vibe).

Fonts: Strong headline font (condensed sans), readable body font (system sans).

Photo guidance: shoot clean before/after, 3 angles, close-up of workmanship, mobile repair in action. Add short video reels (30–60s) for IG + site.

Technical stack & integrations (specific)

CMS/Build: WordPress + Elementor (fast builds, easy client edits). Backups + security plugin (Updraft/Jetpack or similar).
Zapier

Hosting: Managed WordPress hosting (SiteGround, Hostinger, or similar managed hosts). Pick budget vs support based on client needs — SiteGround for support, Hostinger for price.
Tom's Guide
+1

Forms: Elementor form or WPForms; Zapier/Make webhook for SMS & calendar.

Analytics & SEO: Google Analytics, Google Search Console, Yoast or RankMath.

Payments (optional): Stripe or Square for deposits/parts.

Security: SSL (free via host/Let’s Encrypt), firewall plugin, regular backups.

Optional: Instagram feed / YouTube embed for build videos.

UX notes (conversion-focused)

Phone number in header clickable for mobile.

Sticky CTA on mobile: “Book Inspection” (persistent).

Fast load times: compress images, use CDN via host. Mobile-first design — local customers search from phones.
Optimize

Accessibility & Legal

Alt tags for images, contrast checks for text, keyboard navigation for forms.

Add privacy policy, cookie notice if analytics used, clear cancellation/refund policy.

Launch timeline & deliverables (realistic)

I’m giving a timeline so your client stops asking “how’s it coming along” every 12 hours.

Day 0–2: Host + domain setup, Google Business Profile creation.

Day 3–5: Install WP, theme, Elementor, basic security, create homepage + contact page.

Day 6–9: Services pages, booking form wiring, gallery + testimonials, About.

Day 10–12: SEO basics, analytics, Google submission, mobile tweaks.

Day 13–14: QA, client review, revisions, launch.
Total: ~2 weeks for an MVP. If client drags or wants video editing, add time.

Estimated cost (pick a lane)

Budget build (cheap, fast): $600–$900 — basic WP site, off-the-shelf theme, minimal custom work.

Standard pro: $1,200–$2,400 — custom design, gallery, booking workflow, basic SEO.

Full pro + ongoing support: $2,500+ + $40–$120/mo hosting & maintenance.
Be decisive: pick one and sell the value — “I’ll build it clean, teach you the basics, and handle updates for $X/mo.”

SEO launch checklist (quick)

Claim Google Business Profile, add photos and hours.
BabyLoveGrowth

5 service pages + 3 city pages.
anatechconsultancy.com

Add LocalBusiness schema + Service schema.

Add contact phone in H1/H2 (visible to Google).

Start 1 blog per week for 4 weeks to seed long-tail keywords.
Tekmetric

Example micro-copy (copy you can paste)

Hero CTA: Book an inspection — same-day mobile service.
Service card (Engine Service): Full diagnostics, filter & fluid checks, belt & sensor inspection. Starts at $X (est). Book now.
About blur: 15 years fixing everything from desert trucks in Saudi Arabia to daily drivers here. Elbey Projects is mobile, honest, and built on real skills — not YouTube tutorials.
Bet. You already locked the blueprint tight, so now let’s turn that into a **fully actionable starter template** for WordPress/Elementor. I’ll break it down so you could drop this in your client’s lap and make them look like they actually thought this through. I’ll also wire the booking form logic to Zapier for SMS/Calendar.

## Next steps — what I’d actually do if you want me to build it for the customer

1. Get client logo files, 6–12 photos (before/after), 3 testimonial quotes.
2. Confirm domain (I’ll check availability) and hosting plan.
3. Build MVP homepage + booking form, handoff admin access, do quick training (30–45 minutes).

If you want, I’ll also write the homepage copy and service page copy so the client doesn’t embarrass themselves with “I fix cars good” energy.

---

You want me to draft the actual homepage HTML/CMS outline + the exact Elementor layout and the booking form fields wired to Zapier? I can spit that right now. If you want me to pick one hosting provider and set up the Google Business verbiage too, say which lane (budget, standard, or pro) and I’ll lock it in.

You good? Or you want me to start building this blueprint into a working WP starter template?
