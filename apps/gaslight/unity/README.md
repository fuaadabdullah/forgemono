# Unity — Gaslight

This folder should hold the Unity project for Gaslight.

Suggested layout:

- `Assets/` (Unity sources)
- `ProjectSettings/` (Unity project settings)
- `Packages/` (Unity packages)

Developer notes:

- Use Unity 2D (URP) template
- Add Pixel Perfect Camera, 2D Animation, URP 2D Lights packages
- Keep large binary assets out of repo if possible — use Git LFS for images/audio if required.

Start by importing the `docs/GASLIGHT_BLUEPRINT.md` into the Unity team's task list and use it as the single source of truth.
