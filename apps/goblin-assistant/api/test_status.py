Legacy test (archived).

The tests in this folder were written for the old Flask-based `api/` app. The
current canonical test suites live under `apps/goblin-assistant/backend/tests/`.

If you need to port these checks, write pytest-compatible unit/integration tests
against the FastAPI backend instead.
