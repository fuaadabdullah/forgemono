# apps/goblin-assistant/api (archived)

This folder has been archived and consolidated into `apps/goblin-assistant/backend/` on 2025-12-11.
Please use the canonical backend located at `apps/goblin-assistant/backend/` moving forward.

If you relied on scripts that referenced this folder (for example `start_server.sh` or
deployment tooling), update them to reference `apps/goblin-assistant/backend/` instead.

If you need to recover legacy artifacts, see the repository history or contact the maintainers.

This directory is intentionally kept as a read-only archive for a short migration window.
It may be removed in a later cleanup once all references have been updated.
