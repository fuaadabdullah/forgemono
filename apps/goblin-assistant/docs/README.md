# Goblin Assistant — Frontend Documentation (Canonical)

This folder is the canonical location for all frontend-specific documentation and guides for the GoblinOS Assistant UI.

Please use this folder for:

- Local dev and start guides (Vite, Storybook)
- Frontend deployment guides (Vercel)
- Frontend build/test/CI guidance
- Accessibility, theme, and UI guidelines
- Visual regression and Storybook results

If you need to add or update any frontend documentation, please edit files here rather than in backend docs or infra docs. Where possible, backend docs should link to these frontend docs instead of duplicating content.


Key files:

- `PRODUCTION_DEPLOYMENT.md` — Frontend deployment and production security
- `PRODUCTION_PIPELINE.md` — CI/CD pipeline for frontend builds
- `THEME_AND_ACCESSIBILITY_VERIFICATION.md` — Color & accessibility guides
- `PASSKEY_FRONTEND_INTEGRATION.md` — Frontend examples for Passkey / WebAuthn flows
- `ARCHITECTURE_OVERVIEW.md` — Short architecture diagram & request flow for frontend+backend
- `CORE_IDENTITY.md` — High-level product identity, core differentiators, terminology, and target users

Make sure to keep content concise and focused on frontend implementation and deployment.
