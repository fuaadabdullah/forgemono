  participant Router as RoutingService
  participant Provider
  participant Verifier

  Client->>Frontend: Send chat message
  Frontend->>API: POST /v1/chat (auth, tokens)
  API->>Gateway: Pre-flight checks (token budget, rate limiting)
  Gateway->>Router: Classify & Choose provider (RAG decision)
  Router->>Provider: Invoke provider (local or cloud)
  Provider-->>Verifier: Response
  Verifier-->>API: Verified/filtered response

```

Notes:

- Replace `Provider` in the diagram with `Ollama`, `OpenAI`, `Anthropic`, etc. when you want provider-specific flows.
