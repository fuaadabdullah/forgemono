## Deprecated worker fly config
## NOTE: The goblin-assistant worker app was removed from Fly.io to keep
## only the main `goblin-assistant` app active on Fly. This file is retained
## for reference only. Do NOT use this file to launch a separate Fly app.

# If you need background workers in the future, prefer using a separate
# infrastructure (e.g., a managed worker queue or a dedicated Fly app
# created intentionally via `fly launch`) and store its config outside the
# primary repo directory to avoid accidental creation.
