# Health Status Fix - December 2, 2025

## Summary

Fixed the "degraded" status display issue. The services were actually healthy, but the dashboard showed incorrect status due to:

1. API endpoint mismatches between frontend and backend
2. Misinterpretation of health check responses
3. AI provider network checks failing (expected when offline)

## What Was Actually Wrong

### Services Status (ACTUAL)

- ✅ **Backend**: Running on port 8001, fully healthy
- ✅ **Vector DB (ChromaDB)**: File exists, service healthy (0 collections, 0 documents)
- ✅ **Sandbox**: Healthy (0 active jobs, 0 queue)
- ✅ **Database (Supabase)**: Connected and healthy
- ❌ **AI Providers**: Unreachable (OpenAI, Anthropic, DeepSeek, Gemini)
  - This is EXPECTED if you're offline or the APIs are having network issues
  - Does NOT affect core app functionality

### Why It Showed "Degraded"
The overall health endpoint returns "degraded" when ANY check fails, including external AI provider network tests. This is technically correct but confusing because:

- Core services (DB, vector DB, sandbox) were all healthy
- Only the external AI provider APIs were unreachable

## Changes Made

### 1. Fixed API Client Endpoints (`src/api/client-axios.ts`)
Updated all health check endpoints to match backend routes:

- `/health/chroma` → `/health/chroma/status`
- `/health/mcp` → `/health/mcp/status`
- Added `/health/raptor/status` for RAG indexer
- `/health/sandbox` → `/health/sandbox/status`
- `/cost/summary` → `/health/cost-tracking`
- `/health/latency` → `/health/latency-history/{service}`
- `/health/errors` → `/health/service-errors/{service}`
- `/health/retest` → `/health/retest/{service}` (POST)

### 2. Fixed Dashboard Status Interpretation (`src/components/EnhancedDashboard.tsx`)

- RAG status: Check for `rag.status === 'healthy'` OR `rag.running` (was only checking for 'running')
- MCP servers: Handle servers as array (was treating as number)
- RAG metrics: Show "Running" status and config file instead of non-existent fields

### 3. Backend Already Running Correctly

- Process ID: 6300
- Port: 8001
- All endpoints responding correctly
- Environment loaded from `.env` with required encryption keys

## Current State

### Backend Health Check Response

```json
{
  "status": "degraded",
  "checks": {
    "database": { "status": "healthy", "host": "aws-0-us-west-2.pooler.supabase.com", "port": 6543 },
    "vector_db": { "status": "healthy", "path": "/Users/fuaadabdullah/ForgeMonorepo/chroma_db/chroma.sqlite3" },
    "providers": [
      { "Anthropic": { "enabled": true, "status": "unreachable" } },
      { "OpenAI": { "enabled": true, "status": "unreachable" } },
      { "Groq": { "enabled": false } },
      { "DeepSeek": { "enabled": true, "status": "unreachable" } },
      { "Gemini": { "enabled": true, "status": "unreachable" } }
    ]
  }
}
```

### Individual Service Endpoints
- **Sandbox**: `{"status":"healthy","active_jobs":0,"queue_size":0}`
- **Chroma**: `{"status":"healthy","collections":0,"documents":0}`
- **MCP**: Returns list of active MCP servers
- **Raptor**: Returns RAG indexer status

## What To Do Next

### Immediate Action Required
**Reload your browser** at `http://localhost:3000`
- The frontend will now fetch data from the corrected endpoints
- Dashboard should show Vector DB and Sandbox as healthy
- The overall "degraded" badge will still show because AI providers are unreachable, but individual service cards will be green

### If AI Providers Show Unreachable
This is NORMAL when:
1. You're working offline
2. You're behind a firewall/VPN that blocks AI APIs
3. The APIs are experiencing issues

**To verify network connectivity:**
```bash

# Test if you can reach OpenAI
curl -I <https://api.openai.com>

# Test if you can reach Anthropic
curl -I <https://api.anthropic.com>
```

If you CAN reach these APIs but health checks still fail, check your API keys in:

- `apps/goblin-assistant/backend/.env`

### Optional: Disable Provider Health Checks
If you want to work offline without seeing "degraded" status:

Edit `apps/goblin-assistant/backend/.env` and add:

```bash
ANTHROPIC_ENABLED=false
OPENAI_ENABLED=false
DEEPSEEK_ENABLED=false
GEMINI_ENABLED=false
```

Then restart the backend:
```bash

# Kill existing backend
ps aux | grep "uvicorn.*8001" | grep -v grep | awk '{print $2}' | xargs kill

# Restart with updated config
cd apps/goblin-assistant/backend
nohup venv/bin/python -m uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8001 --env-file .env > /tmp/goblin-backend.log 2>&1 &
```

## Verification Commands

### Check Backend is Running

```bash
curl -s http://localhost:8001/health/all | python3 -m json.tool
```

### Check Individual Services
```bash

# Vector DB
curl -s <http://localhost:8001/health/chroma/status> | python3 -m json.tool

# Sandbox
curl -s <http://localhost:8001/health/sandbox/status> | python3 -m json.tool

# Cost Tracking
curl -s <http://localhost:8001/health/cost-tracking> | python3 -m json.tool
```

### Check Frontend is Running

```bash
ps aux | grep "vite.*3000" | grep -v grep
```

## Files Changed
1. `src/api/client-axios.ts` - Fixed all health endpoint URLs
2. `src/components/EnhancedDashboard.tsx` - Fixed status interpretation and metrics
3. `goblin-assistant/.env` - Updated `VITE_FASTAPI_URL=http://localhost:8001`

## Quality Gates
- ✅ Backend running and healthy
- ✅ All core services (DB, vector DB, sandbox) healthy
- ✅ Frontend running on port 3000
- ✅ API endpoint URLs corrected
- ⚠️ AI providers unreachable (expected when offline)
